# H1 locomotion policy dynamics-domain mismatch

The Chinese document is the normative source; this page is its official translation.

## Executed experiment

The locked Unitree RL Gym H1 TorchScript policy was bound to ten leg
joints/actuators through an explicit adapter. Independent PD hold controlled
the torso and eight arm joints in the composed model, while the Robotiq stayed
open. The test ran on macOS arm64, MuJoCo 3.6.0, and Torch 2.12.0 for four
seconds with a `0.5 m/s` forward command.

The interface layer passed:

```text
policy input: 41
policy output: 10, finite
leg mapping: 10
upper-body hold mapping: 9
gripper mapping: 1
```

The behavior layer failed:

```text
final x: -2.224 m
minimum pelvis z: 0.103 m
minimum upright cosine: -0.162
joint-limit violation samples: 1274
```

The failure report is
[`locomotion-conformance.darwin-arm64.failed.json`](../../../examples/h1-kitchen/locomotion-conformance.darwin-arm64.failed.json).

Running the same observation construction, PD parameters, update rate, and
policy for four seconds on Unitree RL Gym's original H1 model produced:

```text
forward displacement: 1.437 m
lateral drift: 0.017 m
minimum pelvis z: 0.990 m
minimum upright cosine: 0.999
```

The current evidence therefore indicates a **dynamics-domain mismatch between
the policy training model and the articulated Menagerie whole-body model**, not
a TorchScript interface or ten-leg-joint mapping error. The right gripper is
not the sole cause: the unmodified Menagerie H1 also falls under the same
control.

## Frozen choice

The user selected `A + R`, recorded in
[ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-h1-target-dynamics-retraining.md):

- adapt or retrain locomotion for Menagerie H1 plus one right Robotiq 2F-85;
- preserve continuous whole-body dynamics and the final L3 semantics;
- retain the old Unitree policy only as an interface or initialization candidate.

The following routes are rejected:

- `B`: build a hybrid H1 from Unitree RL Gym lower-body dynamics;
- `C`: switch models or use kinematic translation during locomotion.

The route-decision blocker is cleared, but the project remains at “training
runtime unlocked, GPU not executed, no new policy.” It cannot enter the kitchen
5/5 L3 state machine before real training and behavior validation.
